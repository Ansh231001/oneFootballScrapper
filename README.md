OneFootball DFS Summarizer
A web scraper and summarization API for OneFootball articles. This project uses Node.js (Puppeteer) to crawl and extract football news articles from onefootball.com, and Python (FastAPI) to provide a streaming API for triggering scrapes and retrieving results. Optionally, it can summarize articles using Groq AI models.

Features
Scrapes top articles and related news from OneFootball using Puppeteer
Recursively follows related articles up to a configurable depth
Stores extracted content and metadata in structured JSON files
(Optional) Summarizes articles using Groq AI models
Provides a FastAPI server with endpoints to trigger scraping and stream results

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Node.js 16+
npm (for installing Node.js dependencies)
A Groq AI API key (for summarization)
1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd oneFootballScraper
2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install Node.js dependencies
npm install puppeteer dotenv groq-sdk
4. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the project root with your API keys:

GROK_AI_API=your_groq_api_key_here        # For summarization
Usage
Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
Trigger a scrape
Open http://localhost:8000/scrape in your browser or use curl:
curl http://localhost:8000/scrape
The scraper will run, and output will be streamed as text events.
Scraped articles are saved under onefootball/articles/ in nested folders.
API Endpoints
GET / — Health check, returns a status message.
GET /scrape — Starts the scraper and streams logs/results as Server-Sent Events (SSE).
Output Format
Each article and its related articles are saved in nested directories, each containing a metadata.json file:

{
  "title": "Is Bayern Munich v Boca Juniors on TV? How to watch Club World Cup game for free",
  "link": "https://onefootball.com/en/news/is-bayern-munich-v-boca-juniors-on-tv-how-to-watch-club-world-cup-game-for-free-41268431",
  "content": "...full article text...",
